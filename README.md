# To-Do
- [x] basic chat where client talks to all clients (boradcasting with no chatroom)
- [x] chatrooms where clients can talk to others located in the same chatroom
- [x] rewrite server code, because it looks awful (it is still)
- [x] add client.py code instead of using telnet
- [x] add ids for clients and chats 
- [x] add some database
    - python file is db
- [x] end-to-end encryption
    - [x] a lot of errors occur, something need to be done, but it is enough for now
        - end-to-end works perfectly fine
- [ ] add some documentation on code
